FLIX Working Group - Jan 2


* FLIX on-chain
   * Requires:
      * On-chain data structure format
      * On-chain FLIX ID generation / verification 
      * Naming FLIX.


* Akos: How should data be stored on-chain?
   * Templates can be co-located in the same accounts as the contracts they interact with are deployed to.
   * Bjarte: If we somehow link contract -> template, we can leverage the existing work done by Chase on Flow CLI dependency manager.
   * Bjarte: Makes more sense for FLIX to be struct rather than resource.
   * How should we serialize the data structure?
      * Jeff: Makes sense to do it as Cadence struct so we can operate on the data structure on-chain to do id generation/verification etc.


* Jeff: FLIX Discovery:
   * Steps:
      * 1. Put FLIX data structures as cadence structs on-chain
      * 2. Have a way to store FLIX structs inside FLIX collections inside accounts 
         * Should emit events etc


* FLIX collection needs to make FLIX structs queryable by:
   * ID
   * Alias/Name
   * Cadence (by network)


      * 3. Create a way to generate name/alias that resolve to FLIX structs (in the account) or other alias (could be to another account).
         * Alias can include routing:
            * “0xABC123DEF456/contract1-purchase-jeff-nft” -> asdf123asdf123
            * “0xABC123DEF456/blah-blah” -> “0xBjarte/blah-blah-blah”
         * Point to FLIX ID:
            * “0xABC123DEF456/contract1-purchase-jeff-nft” -> asd123asdf123…
            * * Jeff: FLIX Publishing:
   * Steps:
      * 1. Flow CLI command to publish projects transactions/scripts as FLIX
      * 2. Put those FLIX inside the users collection in their account
      * 3. FLIX are advertised to an aggregator service (using the events)
