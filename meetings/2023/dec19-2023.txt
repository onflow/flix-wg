FLIX Working Group - Dec 19

* FLIX demo with flow-cli
   * Binding files, Cadence type support, binding supports js and ts.

* Discussion: flow-cli “publish” command
   * Get flix available, PR is annoying, need an automatic that does not rely on an “approval” process to publish FLIX, 
   * Need backend support to index on FLIX v1.1 network_pin. Good to have a source of truth on-chain.
   * Bjarte suggested the concept of “Channels”: .Find, … (unstable). Could be “Approved” and moved to a specific Stable Channel on-chain location.
      * Dapp Channel (in dev, developer account)
      * Global Channel (verified, community action) 0xGlobalAddress/transfer-token is an alias (pointer) 0x11…333/transfer-token
   * Alias, basically a pointer to a newer version of a FLIX cuz tx or script changes cuz smart contracts changed. Gives a way to deprecated old FLIX aka versioning.
   * Structure of on-chain registry aka Channel (protocol)
      * Resource with map[string]Struct. 
         * string key: template id.
         * network pin, template id, formatted flix json
      * Aliases map[string] to template id (to point to specific flix)
      * Dapps auto generate transactions / scripts at runtime
      * (Flow-CLI, use case) 
         * Download flix locally based by network. 
            * <address>/<flix alias> like 0x11…333/transfer-token
            * <address> get all flix at address
         * Auto generate binding files based on <address>
   * (Akos) Channel contract interfaces to create new FLIP with smart contract.
   
* Updated Cadence Docs FLIP PR, https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/80
   * Got approval
